                The big idea
              </h2>
              <p>
                <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89443-6>New research shows that computational
                    modeling
                </a> can predict how bilingual stroke patients will respond to language treatment – and that
                could help clinicians identify which language to focus treatment on and increase chances for improvement
                in both.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href=https://n.neurology.org/content/69/2/200>Aphasia 
                </a>is a speech and language disorder often caused by stroke. Bilingual people with aphasia typically experience difficulty retrieving words in both
                of their languages. While language therapy can help them improve their ability to communicate, it’s not
                often clear to clinicians 
                <a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/10/9/144> which language to target in
                    treatment.

              <p>
                I’m a <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mexG-2kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>cognitive
                    neuroscientist
                     </a>, and my current work focuses on language treatment outcomes in bilinguals with
                aphasia. As part of the 
                <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89443-6>Aphasia Research
                    Laboratory at Boston University </a>, my colleagues and I worked with computer scientists at the
                University of Texas at Austin to develop <a
                    href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89443-6>>BiLex </a>– a <a>computational model</a>
                that simulates the ability to retrieve words from memory in bilinguals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BiLex model is a <a
                    href=https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-neural-network-a-computer-scientist-explains-151897>neural
                    network </a> composed of artificial neurons that are programmed to simulate language processing. Our
                team trained individual BiLex models to <a
                    href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89443-6>simulate word retrieval abilities in
                    Spanish-English bilinguals with aphasia</a> after language treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                We simulated their word retrieval abilities before their stroke and then recreated the effects of stroke
                lesions in each person’s brain by deleting <a
                    href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030100821100147X?via%3Dihub>neurons encoding
                </a>different word sounds and meanings. Our team used varying degrees of damage intensity to simulate
                the levels of word retrieval loss of each patient. We then retrained these BiLex models to simulate the
                effects of language therapy provided in either English or Spanish on both the treated and the untreated
                language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our findings show that BiLex can simulate treatment response, accurately predicting up to 82% of patient
                recovery in the treated language and 60% in the untreated language.

                According to the U.S. Census Bureau report on language use, 83.6% of the foreign-born population aged 5
                and older speaks a language other than English at home, which suggests a large bilingual representation
                in the general population. <a

            <h2>
                 Why it matters
            </h2>
            <p>
                Despite the growing <a
                    href=https://theconversation.com/bilingual-people-with-language-loss-due-to-stroke-can-pose-a-treatment-challenge-computational-modeling-may-help-clinicians-treat-them-164219>bilingual
                    aging population at risk for post-stroke aphasia </a>worldwide, evidence on what language treatment
                works and for whom it works best is still limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, predicting treatment outcomes for bilinguals with aphasia requires large-scale studies over a
                long period of time. This is because each person has unique characteristics that affect their recovery.
                Computational models like BiLex can offer a faster approach by reliably simulating multiple different
                profiles of bilingualism and language impairment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accurate computational simulations of response to language therapy could ultimately help clinicians
                decide which language to treat in bilinguals with aphasia in order to maximize <a
                    href=https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/1058-0360%282013/12-0085%29>treatment response in their two
                    languages.</a>
            </p>
            <h2> What still isn’t known</h2>
            <p>
                While our findings may help develop better and more personalized treatment plans in the future,
                questions about language recovery in bilinguals with aphasia remain unanswered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further research is needed on how people who know two languages differ from people who know just one
                language in their recovery from brain injuries affecting communication. Similarly, little is known about
                what determines aphasia recovery for different language combinations outside of Spanish and English, or
                what factors lead to optimal response to language therapy.
            </p>
            <h2>What’s next</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, our team is conducting a clinical trial to test if BiLex can correctly identify which
                language treatment option will lead to the maximum recovery in both languages on real bilingual
                patients. If study results confirm that BiLex can help identify the optimal treatment language for
                bilinguals with aphasia, our computational model could help clinicians tailor treatment plans to promote
                better recovery in this population in the future.
